# csv_to_pivot_table
This Python script uses pandas library to manage CSV file data in an arrangement similar to that of a pivot table in Excel. This script becomes handy for large CSV files that cannot be opened due to spreadsheet limitations. It allows users to specify their own file path for flexibility.

Notes:

This script assumes your CSV file is not too large for your memory.
